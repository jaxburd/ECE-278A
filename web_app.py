    images to be represented at different scales. Image upsampling (interpolation) is a technique used to \
    approximate higher resolution images while image downscaling (decimation) is used to \
    create lower resolution images while avoiding aliasing')

st.subheader('Interpolation')
st.write('The main idea of interpolation is to approximate a continuous representation of the \
    image using the existing samples, and then use that continuous approximation to resample at a \
    higher rate. There are several different types of interpolation kernels that can be used for \
    this purpose depending on the quality and computational efficiency suited for the application. \
    The approximation and sampling steps of image interpolation are typically combined and implemented in the \
    form of a modified convolution:')

    in unappealing creasing in the rescaled image.')
st.write('Bicubic: Bicubic interpolation is the result of fitting cubic splines to the image data and results \
    in a smoother, more visually appealing result when compared with bilinear interpolation. \
    The main drawback of this technique is that the interpolation convolution requires a 4x4 kernel \
    making it more computationally expensive than Bilinear interpolation')

    every rth sample where integer r is the decimation rate. In the case that r is not an integer, the image can fist be interpolated \
    by integer factor L, then decimated by integer factor M such that r = L/M. Decimation can also be implemented in the form of a \
